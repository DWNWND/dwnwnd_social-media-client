# Workflow CA

This is my course assignment for the course Workflow at Noroff. The course spanned over 4 weeks and we were tasked with "improving the quality of an existing application by providing various development workflows as well as a testing strategy."

## Live site

This repo is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://dwnwnd.github.io/dwnwnd_social-media-client/).

## Course goal

"Using the skills and knowledge from this course, improve the quality of a package by establishing helpful workflows that make the development process more efficient." (copied from the CA requirements)

### Delivery

An open Pull Request from branch workflow into the forkâ€™s default branch.

### Requirements

**Configuration**

- Project is configured to run Prettier on commit
- Project is configured to run ESLint on commit
- Code is versioned and branching conventions have been followed.

**Project changes**

- Project readme file is updated to include new configuration information and workflow status badges
- All known bugs have been communicated in the Issues tab

**Testing**

1. Unit-testing

- The login function stores a token when provided with valid credentials
- The logout function clears the token from browser storage

2. E2E-testing

- The user can log in with the login form with valid credentials
- The user cannot submit the login form with invalid credentials and is shown a message.
